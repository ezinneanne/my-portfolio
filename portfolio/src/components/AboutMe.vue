        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Hi, I’m <strong>Ezinne</strong> — a curious mind who loves turning complex systems into seamless, automated flows and clear, human-centered documentation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          I work at the intersection of <strong>AI automation</strong> and <strong>technical communication</strong>, helping teams save time, simplify chaos, and actually understand their tools. 
          Whether it’s designing smart workflows with <strong>n8n</strong>, <strong>Make</strong>, or <strong>Zapier</strong>, or creating structured API docs that make developers smile — I live for that moment when technology finally <em>makes sense</em> to people.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Over the years, I’ve written docs that power products, built automations that run businesses, and told stories that connect users to technology. 
          My mission is simple: to make tech work smarter — and help people feel confident using it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          When I’m not building or writing, you’ll probably find me exploring new AI ideas, creating digital content, or watching a good film for inspiration.
